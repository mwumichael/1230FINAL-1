<h2>Data </h2>
<!-- Comment: Insert our Mapbox here -->
<br>
Throughout Australia, there are many people who provide unpaid assistance to a person with a disability. This data records the age of these people, as well as their sex. It is an important statistic that considers what kind of people are providing unpaid assistance, where these people are located, and finally, how many of these people are there. This is important data to consider, when we are looking at developing health service facilities, as well as seeing how socioeconomic conditions may affect people with disabilities.

<h2>Analysis </h2>
<!-- Comment: Image to be inserted here, text directly below needs to be in a column to the right -->
<br>
Our data only reflects one of the many symptoms of the ‘Latte line’, that has split the quality of life between north east and south west. Communities south of the ‘Latte line’ can expect less employment opportunities, lower education levels, and less access to essential services leading to areas which are less productive and less liveable. Furthermore with Sydney's growing population, these areas are experiencing an influx of people further exacerbating current problems, while issues around transportation and housing affordability  are also growing.
