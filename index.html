<br>
Throughout Australia, there are many people who provide unpaid assistance to a person with a disability. This data records the age of these people, as well as their sex. It is an important statistic that considers what kind of people are providing unpaid assistance, where these people are located, and finally, how many of these people are there. This is important data to consider, when we are looking at developing health service facilities, as well as seeing how socioeconomic conditions may affect people with disabilities.

<h2>Analysis </h2>
<!-- Comment: Image to be inserted here, text directly below needs to be in a column to the right -->
<br>
Our data only reflects one of the many symptoms of the ‘Latte line’, that has split the quality of life between north east and south west. Communities south of the ‘Latte line’ can expect less employment opportunities, lower education levels, and less access to essential services leading to areas which are less productive and less liveable. Furthermore with Sydney's growing population, these areas are experiencing an influx of people further exacerbating current problems, while issues around transportation and housing affordability  are also growing.

<strong>Villa Radieuse - Le Corbusier</strong>
<img src="Precedent_1.jpg" alt="Precedent_1.jpg" class="center" width="100%">
<br>
 The Ville Radieuse (Radiant City) looked to create effective means of transportation, an abundance of green space and sunlight, and a city that would not only provide residents with better lifestyles, but would contribute to creating a better society. Le Corbusier aspired to achieve this by redefining transportation, pedestrians access areas and built forms into 3 tiers. In addition, built forms had a strict division between their purposes of commerce, business, entertainment and residencies. By quantifying these aspects of urban life and making their purpose and form distinct, Le Corbusier is able to maximise the effectiveness of each component and allow them to integrate into the grand picture of a city.

<strong>Tree</strong>
<img src="Precedent_2.jpg" alt="Precedent_2.jpg" class="center" width="100%">
<br>
 A tree, is formed by distinct elements including: the roots, trunk, branches and leaves. Each element has a distinct form for a distinct purpose, and together they combine into one organism. A tree is also able to change over time with each of its elements growing and adapting to suit the needs of the whole system.

<strong>Druzhba Sanatorium - Igor Valikievsky</strong>
<img src="Precedent_3a.jpg" alt="Precedent_3a.jpg" class="center" width="100%">

<br>
The Druzhba Sanatorium is an ingenious solution that allows human activities to take place while retaining the original flow of nature on the ground plane. Vasilevsky achieves this by elevating the built form, from the ground plane, through three concrete towers. This in essence creates a flying container for human activities leaving nature undisturbed.

<strong>Vertical Village - Adriann Jeevananthan</strong>
<img src="Precedent_4.jpg" alt="Precedent_4.jpg" class="center" width="100%">
<br>
The vertical village redefines the form and purpose of a skyscraper, instead of traditional models, this high rise building is able to adapt, reconfigure and evolve to the needs of a community. With the inhabitants of this tower deciding the purpose of the the tower, and in consequence the form of the tower, they are given a sense of autonomy, self sufficiency and identity. This concept of dynamic buildings that can change over time to the ever changing problems of society, provides built forms with longevity.
