            <p>The map shows the percentage of people among the total population who provide unpaid assistance to a person with a disability by postcode. The areas which have a deeper shade of red are those which have a greater percentage of people who provide unpaid assistance, the height of the region reflects how this percentage has increased between 2011 and 2016. This data shows how there is a growing inequality in the access to paid disability assistance between rural NSW and Sydney. Furthermore, within Sydney itself, we can see how the ‘latte line’ is somewhat reflected, and how there is an imbalance between the access to disability services within inner Sydney and outer Sydney. NSW governments need to address this issue by looking to improve make disability services more accessible by expanding their health services network to outer Sydney and rural NSW, while also improving socioeconomic conditions in the most disadvantaged communities.</p>  
              
              
              
              
        <br>      
        <br>  
            <p>Throughout Australia, there are many people who provide unpaid assistance to a person with a disability. This data records the age of these people, as well as their sex. It is an important statistic that considers what kind of people are providing unpaid assistance, where these people are located, and finally, how many of these people are there. This is important data to consider, when we are looking at developing health service facilities, as well as seeing how socioeconomic conditions may affect people with disabilities.</p>

            <p>Our data only reflects one of the many symptoms of the ‘Latte line’, that has split the quality of life between north east and south west. Communities south of the ‘Latte line’ can expect less employment opportunities, lower education levels, and less access to essential services leading to areas which are less productive and less liveable. Furthermore with Sydney's growing population, these areas are experiencing an influx of people further exacerbating current problems, while issues around transportation and housing affordability are also growing.</p>

            <p>Looking at our data for assignment 2, the greater analysis of the ‘Latte Line’ as well as a wide range of precedents, we have developed a solution that looks to improve the quality of line in South West Sydney. 
<br>
<br>
The ‘Tree of Life’ is our built environment solution. This built form is an idealised form of what a community should look like. This solution looks to reverse the low quality of life and suburban sprawl of South Western Sydney, instead of providing an alternative that looks to centralize housing, community space, services and facilities and transport into one body. Surrounding this body, the land is reclaimed as natural space.

      <div class="ism-caption ism-caption-0">Villa Radieuse - Le Corbusier <br>The Ville Radieuse (Radiant City) looked to create effective means of transportation, an abundance of green space and sunlight, and a city that would not only provide residents with better lifestyles, but would contribute to creating a better society. Le Corbusier aspired to achieve this by redefining transportation, pedestrians access areas and built forms into 3 tiers. In addition, built forms had a strict division between their purposes of commerce, business, entertainment and residencies. By quantifying these aspects of urban life and making their purpose and form distinct, Le Corbusier is able to maximise the effectiveness of each component and allow them to integrate into the grand picture of a city.</div>
