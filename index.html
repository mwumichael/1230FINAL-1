<br>
Throughout Australia, there are many people who provide unpaid assistance to a person with a disability. This data records the age of these people, as well as their sex. It is an important statistic that considers what kind of people are providing unpaid assistance, where these people are located, and finally, how many of these people are there. This is important data to consider, when we are looking at developing health service facilities, as well as seeing how socioeconomic conditions may affect people with disabilities.

Our data only reflects one of the many symptoms of the ‘Latte line’, that has split the quality of life between north east and south west. Communities south of the ‘Latte line’ can expect less employment opportunities, lower education levels, and less access to essential services leading to areas which are less productive and less liveable. Furthermore with Sydney's growing population, these areas are experiencing an influx of people further exacerbating current problems, while issues around transportation and housing affordability  are also growing.

    <strong>Villa Radieuse - Le Corbusier</strong>
    <br>
        The Ville Radieuse (Radiant City) looked to create effective means of transportation, an abundance of green space and sunlight, and a city that would not only provide residents with better lifestyles, but would contribute to creating a better society. Le Corbusier aspired to achieve this by redefining transportation, pedestrians access areas and built forms into 3 tiers. In addition, built forms had a strict division between their purposes of commerce, business, entertainment and residencies. By quantifying these aspects of urban life and making their purpose and form distinct, Le Corbusier is able to maximise the effectiveness of each component and allow them to integrate into the grand picture of a city. </p></div>

    <strong>Tree</strong>
    A tree, is formed by distinct elements including: the roots, trunk, branches and leaves. Each element has a distinct form for a distinct purpose, and together they combine into one organism. A tree is also able to change over time with each of its elements growing and adapting to suit the needs of the whole system.</p></div>

    <strong>Druzhba Sanatorium - Igor Valikievsky</strong>
    <br>
    The Druzhba Sanatorium is an ingenious solution that allows human activities to take place while retaining the original flow of nature on the ground plane. Vasilevsky achieves this by elevating the built form, from the ground plane, through three concrete towers. This in essence creates a floating container for human activities leaving nature undisturbed. </p></div>

    <strong>Druzhba Sanatorium - Igor Valikievsky</strong>
    <br>
    The plan of the Druzhba Sanatorium, features a plan that splits the purposes of the building into its basic primary forms. In the centre we find space for public activities,this is surrounded by 3 circular spaces that provide the space for vertical movement between the floors of the building. Finally these spaces are surrounded by a ring, which features the private spaces of the building.

    The section of the Druzhba Sanatorium, further reflects how the building expands outwards from the centre. The section shows the openness of the central space, due to its public nature, while the exteriors of the building are tight and closed, reflecting their private nature.

    <strong>Vertical Village - Adriann Jeevananthan</strong>
    <br>
    The vertical village redefines the form and purpose of a skyscraper, instead of traditional models, this high rise building is able to adapt, reconfigure and evolve to the needs of a community. With the inhabitants of this tower deciding the purpose of the the tower, and in consequence the form of the tower, they are given a sense of autonomy, self sufficiency and identity. This concept of dynamic buildings that can change over time to the ever changing problems of society, provides built forms with greater longevity.</p></div>
