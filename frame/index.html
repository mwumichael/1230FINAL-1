            <p>The map shows the percentage of people among the total population who provide unpaid assistance to a person with a disability by postcode. The areas which have a deeper shade of red are those which have a greater percentage of people who provide unpaid assistance, the height of the region reflects how this percentage has increased between 2011 and 2016. This data shows how there is a growing inequality in the access to paid disability assistance between rural NSW and Sydney. Furthermore, within Sydney itself, we can see how the ‘latte line’ is somewhat reflected, and how there is an imbalance between the access to disability services within inner Sydney and outer Sydney. NSW governments need to address this issue by looking to improve make disability services more accessible by expanding their health services network to outer Sydney and rural NSW, while also improving socioeconomic conditions in the most disadvantaged communities.</p>

            <p>Our data only reflects one of the many symptoms of the ‘Latte line’, that has split the quality of life between north east and south west. Communities south of the ‘Latte line’ can expect less employment opportunities, lower education levels, and less access to essential services leading to areas which are less productive and less liveable. Furthermore with Sydney's growing population, these areas are experiencing an influx of people further exacerbating current problems, while issues around transportation and housing affordability are also growing.</p>

            <p>Looking at our data for assignment 2, the greater analysis of the ‘Latte Line’ as well as a wide range of precedents, we have developed a solution that looks to improve the quality of life in South West Sydney. 
<br>
<br>
The ‘Tree of Life’ is our built environment solution. This built form is an idealised form of what a community should look like. This solution looks to reverse the low quality of life and suburban sprawl of South Western Sydney, instead providing an alternative that looks to centralize housing, community space, services and facilities and transport into one form. Surrounding this form, land will be reclaimed as natural space.

Le Corbusier aspired to achieve this by redefining transportation, pedestrians access areas and built forms into 3 tiers. In addition, built forms had a strict division between their purposes of commerce, business, entertainment and residencies. By quantifying these aspects of urban life and making their purpose and form distinct, Le Corbusier is able to maximise the effectiveness of each component and allow them to integrate into the grand picture of a city.</div>

      The drawings and renders displays the ‘Tree of Life’ in greater detail. In the images above you can see how services are attached to a set of tracks which scale the length of the main core. Furthermore, each level is able to rotate around the inner core. This allows the building to manipulate its form, bringing services and facilities to residents present demands, similar to how the Rubik’s Cube is able to adapt its various configuration. The built forms design also brings the community together, increasing the population density in an effort to reduce urban sprawl. Finally natural space has been created on the ground plane, as the built environment has been arranged in a vertical form.   
      <br>
      <br>   
      As an ideal community hub, the 'Tree of Life' is a built form that can be used to reduce the improve the low quality of life of the suburbs south of the 'Latte Line' and help reduce reduce the inequality across Sydney.
